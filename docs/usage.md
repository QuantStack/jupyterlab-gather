## Usage

### Starting AR Presentation mode

1. After entering your username and room code and clicking join, you'll be at the preview screen where you can join the call, go back to the previous form, or change the devices you're using.

2. Here is where you can select which camera and microphone you'd like to use for the call.

3. After clicking join you'll be at the main conference screen. There is a control bar on the bottom of the screen with the normal options you'd expect from a video conference tool, with one extra item.

4. This enables the augmented reality mode, allowing you to present GLTF models to the rest of the room. On the sides are several toolbars allowing you to customize the scene.

5. These toolbars allow you to load other models into the scene, currently up to two AR cubes are supported. You can also manipulate the scale of the model.
